# Course-Project
The project has the problem where the inland empire solar salesman and what need to be figured out
is the shorted path and the most low-cost trip. 
program implements a solution to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using a brute-force approach. The TSP is a 
classic optimization problem where the goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits a set of cities and 
returns to the original city.
For the programmiing approchese, Graph representation, The graph is represented using an adjacency list for efficient
memory usage and ease of traversal.
The program uses a brute-force approach to solve the TSP by generating all possible permutations of city visits and 
finding the minimum cost.
